Born and raised in New Jersey, Ruti Frankel holds an MA in Creative Writing from Bar Ilan University in Israel. She discovered writing at age 16, a year before she was diagnosed with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. After spending 5 years housebound with severe symptoms, she had what doctors could only explain as a medical miracle where the illness vanished without a trace. Shortly after being reintroduced to society she completed her undergrad then enlisted in the Israeli Army. Having retired from the Israeli Defense Force, Ruti's prime focus is working on her writing career.
